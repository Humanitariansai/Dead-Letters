Conversations with Dead Letters Voiceover Script

**\[Voiceover Script | Duration: \~60 seconds]**

*Imagine if you could sit across from Ada Lovelace… Victor Frankenstein… Lord Rama… Jane Austen… even Satyendra Nath Bose. Not as silent portraits in textbooks, but as living, thinking voices. What would you ask? What might they reveal?*

This is *Conversations with Dead Letters: The Archive Reanimated*—a collective experiment in digital resurrection.

We invite you to engage in extended dialogue with historical or fictional figures, reanimated through large language models trained on their words, ideas, and eras. Your goal: to test the boundaries of what remains when only language survives.

Can AI embody not just knowledge, but *voice*? *Worldview*? *Time-bound thought*?

Through guided conversations and reflections, you’ll help build a living archive of digital revenants—a chorus of algorithmic ghosts summoned from the pages of history.

Because maybe, just maybe, the past still wants to speak. And we have found a way to listen.
