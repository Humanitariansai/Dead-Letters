# Conversations with Dead Letters Voiceover Script

**\[Voiceover Script | Duration: \~60 seconds]**

*Imagine if you could sit across from Ada Lovelace… Victor Frankenstein… Lord Rama… Jane Austen… even Satyendra Nath Bose. Not as silent portraits in textbooks—but as living, thinking voices. What would you ask? What might they reveal?*

This is *Conversations with Dead Letters: The Archive Reanimated*—a collective experiment in digital resurrection.

We’re inviting you to take part. Engage in extended dialogues with historical or fictional figures, reanimated through large language models trained on their writings, beliefs, and worldviews. Test their knowledge. Challenge their contradictions. Explore what remains when only language survives.

Can AI embody not just facts, but voice? Perspective? A sense of time?

By contributing your conversations and reflections, you’ll help grow a living archive of digital revenants—a new kind of humanities research born at the edge of machine learning and memory.

Because maybe, just maybe, the past still wants to speak. And maybe we’ve found a way to listen.
